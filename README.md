## Description
A full-stack content management system that allows users to post thoughts about any video game, and also comment on othersâ€™ thoughts. 

## Motivation
I wanted to push myself to create an interactive full stack project, at the same time keeping the topic fun and simple.

## Technologies
For the front end I used JavaScript, Express-Handlebars, CSS, HTML, and the back end consists of Node.js, SQL, MySQL, Sequelize, and bcrypt for user authentication. 

## Features
Users can log in and post thoughts about their favorite video game. They can also comment on other individuals posts as well!

## Deployment
Deployment link here: https://be-tethical-production.up.railway.app/

## Troubleshooting
This site does not have a 'forgot password' button they can click if they forgot their password, so I encourage users to write it down!
